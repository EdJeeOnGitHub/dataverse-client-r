#' @param version A character string specifying a version of the dataset. This can be one of \dQuote{:draft} (the current draft), \dQuote{:latest} (the latest draft, if it exists, or the latest published version), \dQuote{:latest-published} (the latest published version, ignoring any draft), or \dQuote{x.y} (where \samp{x} is a major version and \samp{y} is a minor version; the \samp{.y} can be omitted to obtain a major version). In lieu of this, a dataset's version-specific identification number can be used for the \code{dataset} argument.
